Long Problems

Question 1 (TCP Reno/ect)

Question 2 (Longest prefix matching in router)

Question 3 (Subnet IP address assigning)

Question 4 (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, need to know how to get shortest path tree after making the table, need to know how to make forwarding table from shortest path tree)

Question 5 (Distance vector algorithm, fill in 3 tables exactly like homework, need to also fill a routing table with next hop)
