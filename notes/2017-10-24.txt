More on Congestion Control

Congestion control happens on the server side.
cwnd is the congestion window, which is a limit on non-acked data
The issue in congestion control is developing an algorithm for determining cwnd

One question on final will be about the value of cwnd and such

ssthresh is slow start threshold, initially is an estimate
Be able to identify slow start vs. congestion avoidance

Be sure to floor the values on the exam

round  |  segment #
1           1
2          2-3
3          4-7
4          8-15
5          16-31
6          32-63
7          64-96

The 70th segment is sent in round 7
Will probably be on exam

Congestion avoidance has additive increase with multiplicative decrease.


TCP fairness

Within K TCP sessions with the same link with bandwidth R, all should on average have R/K

UDP is not fair
UDP is as such used for media applications

There is also E2E congestion control called Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
ToS is type of service in the IP header
They are set to 11 by a congested router


Network Layer

Forwarding - Takes in a packet then outputs it
Routing - Determines the route a packet will take

There are two planes of the network layer
  Data plane
  Control plane
