More Control Plane with WAN routing

Project 1 Demos - Could do it next week or last class

Hot potato routing
  Routers send the packet away right away
  Ignore the inter-domain cost

BGP Policy
  ISP's often will not route traffic that isn't between customer networks
  This can be handled through advertising only paths with proper endpoints if they pass through the AS
  Policy is only used in inter-AS routing

We now have finished the BGP Protocol


SDN Control Plane

Software Defined Networking (SDN)
  A per-router control plane uses algorithms such as distance vector

  SDN takes the control plane and puts it on centralized servers instead

  CA is control agents (routers in this SDN system)

  SDN has many benefits
    Config
    Easier to program for
    Open standards for control plane
    Can base forwarding of packets on any header value in transport, network, or link layer

  Control and data plane is separated
  Control is not a part of switches, so it is easier to manage

  3 layers of an SDN controller
    OpenFlow/SNMP for communication with controlled devices (Called Southbound APIs)
    Network-wide state management - Distributed database
    Interfaces for control applications - Routing, access control, and load balancing application use REST APIs (Called Northbound APIs)

  OpenFlow protocol
    Important southbound API
    Can use TLS
    See slides for details

  Routing on the SDN typically uses Dijkstra's algorithm

  Forwarding and flow tables are not the same thing

ICMP
  Internet Control Message Protocol

  ICMP is a part of IP (It is carried inside the IP datagram)

  Two important codes: TTL expired and destination port unreachable
  Traceroute uses these, the way TTL is set made each router disard the datagram and send an ICMP message type 11, code 0 (Time exceeded)

  ICMP message has the router's CName, IP, etc.

  When the ICMP message hits the destination, it sends back a type 3 code 3 (port unreachable) because the destination port set in the original message is unlikely (like 38241 or something)

SNMP
  Simple network management protocol

  A managed device is a device in a managed network
  A managed device has managed objects (components), and their data is stored in a Management Information Base (MIB)

  An agent is a process running in the device
  Agents communicate with the managing entity on the managing server

  There are two ways to convey data
    Request/response mode, more common
    Trap mode
      The agent sends a trap message to the managing entity
      If something happens this sort of message will be sent

There are two main functions in the network layer
  Routing
  Forwarding

Routing is in the control plane, forwarding is in the data plane

Two bases for forwarding
  IP Address
  Flow

IP Address is traditional whereas flow is used in SDN

A generic router has 4 components
  Routing processer
  Switching fabric
  Routing input ports
  Routing output ports

Everything outside the routing processor is in the forwarding data plane
The forwarding data plane is implemented in hardware and works in nanoseconds

An Input Port:
  Line termination (physical bits from the link interface) --> Link layer protocol --> Forwarding --> Switch fabric

Destination-based forwarding uses only to destination IP, generalized forwarding uses the whole packet

IP addresses themselves work how you would expect

Switching Fabrics
  The forwarding functionality happens in hardware in the switching fabric

  Three main switching fabric types
  Not a focus for this class
    Memory, bus, and crossbar (don't need to know details)
  Each increases scale, crossbar is only needed for very serious routers

  HOL (Head of the line) blocking: if a queued datagram is going through the fabric and can't go through because the earlier queued datagram goes first
  The queuing of datagrams happens not in the fabric, but in the input and output ports

  The scheduling discipline determines which to use from the queue

  If a buffer is full then packets are discarded according to the discord policy
  There is FIFO and priority scheduling

  All scheduling is no-interrupt here

  Round robin scheduling is round robin on interface, not on time
  Each interface takes turn, if it is empty the turn is over otherwise the packet is sent and the turn is over

  Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)
    More general Round Robin
    Each class gets a weighted amount of bandwidth in each cycle
