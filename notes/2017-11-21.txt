Link Layer

Hosts called nodes
Paths called links (wireless or wired)

Packet - frame

Ethernet, 802.11, etc. are all treated as if they are directly connect

Datagram from the network layer is encapsulated into a frame with a header and footer

Reliable transfer is used more often for wireless links since they are high-error

It is implemented in the network adapter (NIC)

EDC (Error detection and correction bits)
The EDC field is sent with a datagram to find errors

CRC (Cyclic redundacy check)
  Generator done by left shifting then xoring with CRC bits at the end

Two kinds of links
  Point to point
    Point-to-point link between Ethernet switch and host
  Broadcast
    802.11
    Ethernet

Partitioning channels
  TDMA - time division multiple access
  Divides time into frames, each station getting fixed length slots

Random acceess protocol
  When there is a packet to send
  There are collisions: multiple nodes may try to send at the same time
  Various protocols to solve this
    Slotted ALOHA
      There are timed slots not reserved for any particular node
      If these is a collision, it will be detected before the end of the slot
      Frames are constant size

      Since it is decentralized it works nicely
      Clock synchronization is required

      Some slots are idle or wasted due to many collisions

      1/e collision probability

    Pure ALOHA
      Like slotted ALOHA except without slots
      Pros
        Simple
      Cons
        Everything else

      1/2e probability of collision

    Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
      If channel is idle - transmit entire frame
      If channel is busy - defer transmission

      Collisions can still occur due to transmission delay
      CSMA by itself does not detect collisions
      There is a CSMA with collision detection but it imposes some restrictions on which hardware may be used (difficult in wireless)

    Ethernet CSMA/CD algorithm
      Stops transmission and sends a jam signal on detection of a collision
      After this the NIC enters a backoff mode
      The backoff more chooses the next frame as being K frames away
      K = [0, 1, 2, ..., 2^m - 1].sample
      Don't need to remember the whole thing
      Remember the name "backoff"

      Efficiency goes to 1 as propagation delay decreases and transmission delay increases

    Polling protocol
      One node must be specified as master with a number of slave nodes
      Grants nodes turns based on round robin

    Token passing protocol
      Pass a token between the nodes in a fixed order
      Has a single point of failure, overhead from the token
      Not popular now that ethernet is in wide use

  The above are various Multiple Access Control (MAC) protocols

Cable Access Network
  CMTS - cable modem termination system, located at the end of the ISP's network, connects to consumer modems
  Of FDM and TDM, either can be used

  Mini-slot frame is an example of a downstream MAP frame (they are a part of the main frame used in various protocols like 802.16 mesh mode)

LAN
  48-bit MAC address is software-configurable
  This is the physical address of a node

  If you liken it to a SSN, the government is very lax

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
  Determines MAC given IP
  All IP nodes maintain an IP table
  IP address, MAC address, TTL is the structure of a row

  Somewhat similar to DNS but has some differences
  ARP is local to a particular network
  DNS is an internet-level protocol

  Steps
    Send an ARP query (broadcast like DHCP) with IP address
    B responds with it's MAC address

Routing algorithm finds the router IP to send a datagram

DHCP is only for hosts getting their own IP

Each router interface has a MAC address since each interface has its own NIC

Ethernet
  Main wired LAN
  Different Topologies
    Bus
      Used a coaxial cable
      Many hosts on single channel
    Star (modern)
      Switch between nodes
      No shared channels
