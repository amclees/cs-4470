Internet Protocol (IP)

IPv6 has simplified packet structure compared to IPv4

IPv4 datagrams may be fragmented
They are only reassembled at the final destination host, not in routers beforehand

Different router or host interfaces have different IP addresses

The subnet part of the IP address has significance
  If 2 routers have the same subnet part of the IP address they do not need another router to communicate with other members of the same subnet

For packet transmission there are two important protocols: IP and ARP
  ARP maps an IP address to a link layer (ethernet or otherwise) address
  IP is used for sending data across multiple routers

Subnet masks are masks for the subnet

Routers also form subnets

Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)
  Format of addressing

255.255.255.255 is the address to send to all hosts on the same subnet

Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
  Allocates IP addresses, DNS

223.1.17.0/24
  223.1.17.0000 0000/25 = 223.1.17.0/25
  223.1.17.1000 0000/26 = 223.1.17.128/26
  223.1.17.1100 0000/26 = 223.1.17.192/26

  It is quicker to do without binary, just add the last step's block size

Two main ways to get the IP address
  Can be hardcoded
  Can use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

DHCP
  A DHCP server responds to subnet client DHCP requests
  Uses the broadcast IP address (255.255.255.255) to broadcast to any potential server
  yiaddr (your IP address) is the address offered by the DHCP server

Network Address Translation
  The local network has just 1 IP to the outside world
  It has a table from WAN address to LAN address called the NAT translation table
  65536 ports, so it can be an issue

IPv6
  IPv4 is filling up
  Has header changes to speed up forwarding and help with QoS

  The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is difficult
    Not all routers can suddenly be updated because interrupting traffic is not an option
  Tunneling
    IPv6 can be the payload inside an IPv4 packet

Next semester we will go over a new protocol
  Neighbor Adjacent Protocol
    It is used to determine the protocols used by neighbors
    This is needed for determining when to wrap the IPv6 packet in an IPv4 packet

Now we will describe generalized forwarding (the key to SDN)

The central routing controller sends a flow table to each router
  3 columns
    Head
      Source/destination
    Count
      Priority, count of packets that match
    Action
      What to do
  One entry in the table is called a flow
  Highest priority flow is used

  OpenFlow entries
    Rule
    Action
    Stats

  Can be used as a firewall

  Can be used on switches and routers because rules may be based on MAC addresses

  MAC address (media access control)

  Applies to NAT also (rewrite address and port)

OpenFlow
  The OpenFlow controller distributes flow tables
