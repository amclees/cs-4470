BitTorrent

Trackers keep track of the peers in the torrent
Multiple trackers may be in one torrent

Churn is the switching out of peers over time

The rarest chunks are requested first to keep the torrent going despite churn
Data is send to the peers who are sending the most data to you -> tit-for-tat

Tit-for-tat and rarest-first algorithms will be on midterm

CDNs deliver content globally
Cloud servers can create different versions of each video for different devices


Transport Layer

In exam question on packet name for layers
Transport layer packets are called segments
IP - datagram
Link layer - frame

---------
App
---------
Transport
---------
Network
---------

Switching between the layers is multiplexing and demultiplexing

Network is for communication between hosts
Transport layer is for communication between processes

The transport is in the end systems, the network is like a postal service

Demultiplexing is going up in the layers

Servers have differents sockets for each client
UDP uses destination IP and port to identify clients (the data must specify who is connecting)
TCP multiplexes clients to different sockets

UDP is more barebones

IP is in the network layer -> it does not guarantee order and has packet loss

UDP can have app-specific error handling

UDP checksum is used to detect errors
It is the one's complement of the sum with wrapping around of the other fields


How is reliable data transfer of TCP achieved

It sits on top of an unreliable data transfer channel

A finite state machine is used for these protocols, they are not stateless

Reliable data transfer theoretically has no bit errors and no packet loss

The unreliable protocol may flip bits
This must be fixed

This RDT from the slides will have its own problem on the midterm

ACK - acknowledge
RST - reset
NAK - negative acknowledge
