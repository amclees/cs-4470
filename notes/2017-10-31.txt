Dijkstra's algorithm is also known as link state algorithm

Distance vector algorithm

Uses the Bellman-Ford equation to calculate distance
The router receives data from neighbors rather than knowing the entire network topology

The distance to somewhere is the sum of
  the distance to a neighbor from here
  the distance from a neighbor to there

At certain times each node sends its distance vector estimates to neighbors
When a node receives a new estimate it updates its own estimate

"Good news" is when link costs decrease
Good news actually travels fast

"Bad news" travels very very slowly

Routing needs to be scalable for the whole internet

Routers are group into autonomous systems (AS) also called domains
All routers in an AS use the same protocol
Gateway routers handle communication between AS's

Inter-AS routing must determine how to sent packets through other AS's

OSPF - Open Shortest Path First protocol
Intra-AS
Publicly available
Uses link state algorithm
Each node has a complete topology map

The network can be split into areas, which each have their own link state algorithm
The routers between areas are called backbone routers
There is one area border router but backbone routers may be individual, outside any area

BGP - Border Gateway Protocol
Inter-AS

2 types
  eBGP - external
  iBGP - internal

Makes sure all routers on the internet learn of new subnets

LAN is a subnet

A subnet consists of computers that can reach each other without an intervening router

Back to BGP

There is a BGP session

Two BGP routers called peers exchange BGP messages over TCP
They advertise paths to destination network prefixes
The AS "promises" to forward datagrams to a particular path

The AS advertises a prefix and attributes
These two components make up the "route"

Two main attributes
  AS-PATH - list of AS's through which prefix advertisement has passes
  NEXT-HOP - IP address of the first router in the AS-PATH

AS policy determines whether or not to advertise a path to other AS's

IP address of leftmost interface of 2a for next hop on slides 5-49

Each router has different IP's for different interfaces

  UPDATE
  KEEPALIVE
  NOTIFICATION

The router sets forwarding table entries to distant paths based on the iBGP-designated gateway router and the gateway router uses the eBGP next hop
All of this is based on the policy
